# Agenda for 10am May 29 (Fri) 2020

The followings are the presenters whom Prof. Gunho Sohn invited to give a presentation to the group. 

### May 29nd , 2020
  - Weakly supervised and university bounding box regression (**Jacob Yoo**)
    - Zhang, C.H., Cao, Y.H. and Wu, J., 2020. Rethinking the route towards weekly supervised object localization. arXiv:2002.11359v2 [cs.CV] 3 Mar 2020.
    - Lee, S., Kwak, S. and Cho, M., 2019. Universal bounding box regression and its applications. arXiv:1904.06805v1 [cs.CV] 15 Apr 2019. 
  - Section 3.3 - Recent advances in deep learning for object detection (**Zhen Liu**)
  - ConerNet and CenterNet (**Muhammad Kamran**)
<br/>


### Notice from Professor
I (Prof. Gunho Sohn) split the group into two (one who recently joined the lab and the other who already started their program since last year).
The first group will be asked to review the sections in the review paper (recent advances in deep learning for object detection attached), 
while the second group will review specific paper).

For the next week (May 29th), I would like to invite Zhen and Kamran to lead the group reading on Friday.  
  - Zhen:  Section 3.3 - Recent advances in deep learning for object detection
  - Kamran: ConerNet and CenterNet

Kamran's reading is related to keypoint-based object detection and you can find a summary of this field in the same review paper (Section 3.4.3). 
It is important everyone gets familiar with the papers and actively participate in the group discussion - learning and teaching each other as a group. 

I uploaded the papers for the next week's reading club in the dropbox.

### Note for Jacob
I (Prof. Gunho Sohn) am sending one paper (Relation-Shape Convolutional Neural Network for Point Cloud Analysis) for your review. 
It was published in ICCV 2019. I keep searching for papers related to feature representation for segmentation, instance detection and clustering.
It will help you to design your deep sampling.
