### Review
This section will review the fundamentals and current advancement of object detection. Many of you are working on this topic and familiar with most of the papers listed. However, I want you to pay attention to the following questions:
  - Understanding:
    - anchor-based, anchor-free
    - object proposal vs detector
    - regression (entire class, per single class weight update, class-agnostic, weekly supervised, universal, attention-guided)
  - Question:
    - how to transfer the knowledge/weights to detect unknown classes?
    - how to fine-tune-regress the bounding box proposal?
    - how to generate the labels for the bounding box object detection?
    - how to apply it to video sequences?
    - how to apply it fo multiple instances?
    - how to make the feature vector deeper for bound box generation?
    - does the performance increase or decrease if classified, detector and segmentation are co-supervised?

Best regards,
Gunho
